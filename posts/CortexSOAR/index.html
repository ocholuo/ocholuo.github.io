This caused significant fatigue among their five SOC analysts. They were not addressing false positives and duplicate incidents. They also wanted to streamline their threat indicator management processes, which were distributed and complex. They saw risk and a drain on SOC resources.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Response Esri deployed Cortex XSOAR Enterprise in addition to their existing SIEM and Network Monitoring solutions. For quicker triage and response to their high incident volume, they used custom playbooks that combined automated and manual tasks. These playbooks incorporated analyst knowledge to enable standardized responses to specific attacks. For false positives and deduplication, Esri used Cortex XSOAR’s historical cross-correlation capabilities. By quickly highlighting common artifacts and indicators across incidents, Esri analysts were able to find duplicate attacks reduce redundant investigations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Customer Esri applies advanced geospacial technology to help more than 350,000 customers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Challenge With more than 2.8 million subscribers, it is critical for this customer to protect its digital and infrastructure assets from compromise. The customer offers a broad range of services, and security is a multi-team effort. It was a challenge to coordinate among security, development, and production teams, for both security operations and incident response. There was no defined SOC team, a hundred daily alerts, and lost time during incident handoffs. There were a variety of ingestion and detection sources. A SIEM aggregated logs and machine data into alerts, but some incidents also flowed in via mailboxes where employees forwarded suspected phishing emails. There was no unified console to view alerts and respond at scale.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Response The customer solves these challenges by deploying Cortex XSOAR along with its existing SIEM, threat intelligence, email, and behavioral analysis solutions. Cortex XSOAR’s orchestration enabled alerts to be ingested across sources, and the customer directed alerts from its SIEM and mailboxes into Cortex XSOAR for visibility, triage, and response. The customer deployed a custom playbook that coordinated across a range of products for automated malware enrichment and response. The playbook receives alerts from the SIEM and runs initial threat intelligence actions to obtain indicator reputation. It then retrieves endpoint details using integrations with relevant tools and runs behavioral analytics using a customer-owned custom tool. It uses Cortex XSOAR to control infected endpoints.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Business Use Cases</strong></p><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MTTRs</code> (reduce customers’ mean time to response) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLAs</code> (achieve their service level agreements).<li>Customers commonly have security SLAs with no specific tools to implement them.
