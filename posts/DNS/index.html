names are arranged in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hierarchy</code><ul><li>read by examining a domain name from right to left.<li>Big huge servers might handle a namespace as big as the top-level domain “.com”<li>another server further down the line holds all the records for “mheducation.com.”</ul><li>each server only has to worry about the name records for its own portion of the namespace<li>and to know how to contact the server “above” it in the chain for the top-level namespace the client is asking about.<li>Lower-level domains can point upward to higher-level DNS servers to resolve non-local FQDNs<li>example:<ul><li>www.example.com<li><strong>root domain</strong>: a top-level domain (TLD) of <code class="language-plaintext

Internet to access one or more devices inside your network),<li>But that record could be incorrect if your device obtains a new IP address from your service provider.</ul><li>To overcome such a challenge, turn to <strong>dynamic DNS (DDNS)</strong><ul><li>A DDNS provider provide software run on PCs<li>monitors the IP address of the device referenced in DNS record (cable modem or DSL modem)<li>If the software detects a change in the monitored IP address, that change is reported to your service provider, which is also providing DNS service.</ul></ul><p><strong>Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS)</strong></p><ul><li>another DNS variant is Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS).<ul><li>The original specification for DNS had size limitations:<ul><li>prevented the addition of certain features (like security features)</ul><li>EDNS supports these additional features, while maintaining backwards compatibility with the original DNS implementation.<li>EDNS sends optional pseudo-resource-records between devices supporting EDNS.<ul><li>Rather than using new flags in the DNS header, which would negate backwards compatibility.<li>These records support 16 new DNS flags.<li>If a legacy DNS server were to receive one of these optional records, the record would simply be ignored.<li>(backwards compatibility is maintained, while new features can be added for newer DNS servers)</ul></ul></ul><hr /><h3 id="dns-packet-structure-53">DNS Packet Structure [53]</h3><ul><li>Name lookups generally use UDP<li><strong>zone transfers</strong> use TCP.<ul><li><code

order.<li>Uses round robin.<li>Does not support health checks.</ul><li>Weighted round robin routing WWR<ul><li>a network scheduling discipline 纪律<li>Weighted routing policies are based on the weight of each record and total weight of associated weighted records.<li>the number of packets served is in proportion to the assigned weight, and in inverse proportion to the size of the packets.<li>specify a weight per IP address<li>create records that have the same name and type and assign each record a relative weight.<li>Numerical value that favours one IP over another.<li>Weights can be any number between 0 and 255<li>To stop sending traffic to a resource: change the weight of the record to 0.<li>route traffic to multiple resources in proportions 均衡 that you specify.<li>assign weights to resource record sets, to specify the desired access frequency with which different responses are served.<li>Example:<li>You might want to use this capability to do A/B testing<li>testing a new application<li>send a small portion of traffic to a server where you made a software change, see if it works.<li>send a small amount of that traffic to the new application to see if everything is working properly<li>have two record sets that are associated with one DNS name: one with weight 3 and one with weight 1.<li>75 percent of the time, Amazon Route 53 will return the record set with weight 3<li>25 percent of the time, Amazon Route 53 will return the record set with weight 1.</ul><li>Latency routing (LBR)<ul><li>For every record that you created that uses latency-based routing, you specify the region.<li>resources in multiple AWS Regions<li>route traffic to the Region that provides the best latency.<li>Fastest connection to the application.<li>Provides the fastest experience nased on actual performance measurements of the different AWS regions where app in running.<li>Improve application’s performance for a global audience.<li>routing the customers to the AWS endpoint (for example, EC2 instances, Elastic IP addresses, or load balancers) that provides the fastest experience based on actual performance measurements of the different AWS Regions where the application runs.<li>improving performance by routing to the region with the lowest latency.<li>create latency records for resources in multiple EC2 locations.<li>Route 53 consults a latency database each time a request occurs to a given latency-based host in DNS from the resolver server.</ul><li>Geolocation routing<ul><li>choose the resources that serve the route traffic based on<li>the location of the users.<li>Or the origin of the DNS queries.<li>Can be used for spreading load evenly between regions.<li>If you have multiple records for overlapping regions, Route 53 will route to the smallest geographic region.<li>can create a default record for IP addresses that do not map to a geographic location.<li>If a requestor’s IP can’t be placed to a geographic location or no record exists for that location, they will receive a defaulted version of a website (if a default record is placed).<li>can localize the content:<li>present different content to users in different geographic regions.<li>present website in the language of the users.<li>Caters to different users in different countries and different languages.<li>Contains users within a particular geography and offers them a customized version of the workload based on their specific needs.<li>Can also protect distribution rights.<li>restrict the distribution of content to only the locations where have distribution rights.<li>balancing the load across endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way,<li>so that each user location is consistently routed to the same endpoint.<li>If multiple Geolocation records are present for overlapping regions, it will route based on the most specific path to its user’s location.<li>priority goes to the smallest geographic region, specific of the requestor.</ul><li>Geoproximity routing (requires Route Flow):<ul><li>route traffic based on the distances between users and the resources if you’re using Route 53 traffic flow<li>and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.<li>can route more or less traffic to each resource by specifying a positive or negative bias.<li>In AWS, When create a traffic flow policy, you can specify either an AWS Region, or the latitude and longitude for each endpoint</ul><li>Failover routing (DNS failover)<ul><li>Failover routing allows you to create 2 records with the same name.<li>Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.<li>Associated with a health check.<li>track the health status of the resources and take action when an error occurs.<li>Routes only when the resource is healthy.<li>help detect an outage of the website and redirect the users to alternate locations where the application is operating properly.<li>health-checking agents will monitor each locationor endpoint of the application to determine its availability.<li>Creating health checks to monitor the health and performance of the web applications, web servers, and other resources.<li>Each health check that you create can monitor one of the following<li>the health of a specified resource, such as a web server;<li>the status of other health checks;<li>the status of an Amazon CloudWatch alarm.<li>Can be used with ELB.<li>You can take advantage of this feature to<li>increase the availability of the customer-facing application.<li>Configuring backup and failover scenarios for the own applications.<li>Enabling highly available multi-Region architectures on AWS.<li>configure backup and failover scenarios for the applications with Route 53 ⁃<li>The process of configuring these Route 53 settings is minimal<li>improve health checks by combining multiple health checks, using domain name interval.<li>string matching: the health check looks for a particular string in the page body, within the first 5 KB of content.<li>could use string matching to confirm whether the DB instance is working by matching on a string that the page would contain only if it successfully connects to the DB.<li>When used with Alias records set Evaluate Target Health to “Yes” and do not use health checks.<li>Failover to the static backup site would then be triggered in the following situations:<li>the web server goes down,<li>the DB instance goes down,<li>if the web server hangs,<li>or if the web server returns invalid content<li>example of how DNS failover works in a typical architecture for a multi-tiered web app<li>Route 53 passes traffic to an ELB load balancer, which then passes the traffic to a fleet of EC2 instances that use Auto Scaling.<li>do the following tasks with Route 53 to ensure high availability<li><ol><li>create two DNS records for the CNAME www with a routing policy of Failover Routing.</ol><li>The first record is the primary, points to the ELB load balancer for web application.<li>The second record is the “Secondary” route policy, points to the static Amazon S3 website.<li>If something happened to the primary link, traffic would automatically be redirected to the static website that’s hosted in the S3 bucket.<li>Failover to a secondary IP address.<li>Use Route 53 health checks to make sure the primary is up.<li>If is the primary is up, all traffic will default to the web application stack. ⁃ ⁃</ul><li>Multivalue answer routing<ul><li>configure Amazon Route53 to return multiple values (like IP addresses for the web servers) in response to DNS queries.<li>route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources,<li>Iike web servers, you can create one multivalue answer record for each resource<li>associate an Amazon Route 53 health check with each record<li>configure Route 53 to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses so can use DNS to improve availability and load balancing.<li>Use when you want Route53 to respond to DNS queries with up to 8 healthy records that selected at random.<li>can specify multiple values for almost any record,<li>enables to check the health of each resource so that Route53 returns only values for healthy resources.<li>not a substitute for a load balancer<li>but the ability to return multiple health-checkable IP addresses is a way to use DNS to improve availability and load balancing.<li>Example<li>manage an HTTP web service with a dozen web servers that each have their own IP address.<li>No one web server could handle all of the traffic,<li>create a dozen multivalueanswer records, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records in response to each DNS query.<li>Amazon Route 53 gives different answers to different DNS resolvers.<li>If a web server becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software can try another IP address in the response.</ul></ul><hr /><p>Multi-Region deployment.</p><ul><li>two deployments<li>one in the us-west-2 Region on the west coast of the United States,<li>one in the Asia Pacific Southeast Region.<li>Both load balancers will respond to http://amgogreen.com .<li>The load balancers will direct the user to the closest http://amgogreen.com.<li>offers a better user experience.<li>If the west coast site went down, all traffic would
