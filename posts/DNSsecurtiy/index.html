system connects to the web site using the IP address.</ul><li>provides reverse lookups<ul><li>client sends an IP address to a DNS server with a request to resolve it to a name.</ul><li>Some

</font><ol><li>Change the host file - need administrator.<li>Hack the local DNS - redirect it to malicious DNS server.<ul><li>White hat: stop unwilling website reading.<li>Black hat: steal data information.</ul></ol><p>DNS is an integral part of most Internet requests, it can be a prime target for attacks. DNS servers is vulnerable to a broad spectrum of attacks, including</p><ul><li>DNS poisoning,<li>pharming<li>amplification,<li>DoS (Denial of Service),<li>the interception of private personal information.</ul><p>Example:</p><ul><li>attacker try to spoof the computer’s identity by using a different name during a session.<li>However, the Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) packets in the session include the IP address of the masquerading system and a reverse lookup shows the system’s actual name.<li>If the names are different, it shows suspicious activity.<li>Reverse lookups are not 100 percent reliable because reverse lookup records are optional on DNS servers.<li>However, they are useful when they’re available.</ul><hr /><h3 id="dns-lookup">DNS lookup</h3><p>attacks when DNS lookup for a resource:</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>a person is trying to connect to your FTP server to upload some sensitive data.<li>The user types in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftp.anycomp.com</code> and presses enter.<li>The DNS server closest to the user (defined in your TCP/IP properties) looks through its cache to see whether it knows the address for ftp.anycomp.com.<li>If it’s not there,the server works its way through the DNS architecture to find the <strong>authoritative server</strong> for anycomp.com, which must have the correct IP address.<li>This response is returned to the client, and FTP-ing begins</ul><p>Suppose an attacker want that sensitive data.</p><ul><li>DNS poisoning<ul><li>attacker change the cache on the local name server to point to a bogus server instead of the real address for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ftp.anycomp.com</code><li>Then the user would connect and upload the documents directly to your server.</ul></ul><p>one simple mitigation</p><ul><li>restrict the amount of time records can stay in cache before they’re updated.</ul><p>NOTE DNS poisoning is of enough importance that an entire extension to DNS was created, way back in 1999.</p><ul><li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)</code> is a suite of IETF specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by DNS.<li>Dan Kaminsky made DNS vulnerabilities widely known back around 2010, and many service providers are rolling this extension out to ensure that DNS results are cryptographically protected.</ul><p>setting up DNS required not only a hierarchical design but someone to manage it.</p><ul><li>someone had to be in charge of registering who owned what name and which address ranges went with it.<li>someone had to hand out the addresses in the first place.</ul><hr /><h3

on.<li>These subdomains don’t actually exist, so the name server for the target domain, example.com, just ignores these requests.<li>Simultaneously, the attacker issues responses for each of these requests, each with a guessed transaction ID.<li>The attacker now has so many chances to correctly guess the response ID<ul><li>no competition from the target domain to worry about<li>it is relatively
