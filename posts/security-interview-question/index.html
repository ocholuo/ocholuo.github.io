Why are professional ethics important in the information</p><li>What is the difference between threat, vulnerability, and a risk?<ul><li>A threat is from an attacker that will use a vulnerability that was not mitigated because someone forgot to identify it as a risk.<li>Vulnerability (weakness) is a gap in the protection efforts of a system, a threat is an attacker who exploits that weakness.<li>Risk is the measure of potential loss when that the vulnerability is exploited by the threat.</ul><li>difference between a vulnerability and an exploit?<ul><li>vulnerability, a potential problem<li>exploit, an active problem.<li>Think of it like this: You have a shed with a broken lock where it won’t latch properly. In some areas such as major cities, that would be a major problem that needs to be resolved immediately, while in others like rural areas its more of a nuisance that can be fixed when you get around to it. In both scenarios it would be a vulnerability, while the major cities shed would be an example of an exploit - there are people in the area, actively exploiting a known problem.</ul><li>How would you find out what a POST code means?<ul><li>POST is one of the best tools available when a system will not boot. Normally through the use of either display LEDs in more modern systems, or traditionally through audio tones, these specific codes can tell you what the system doesn’t like about its current setup. Because of how rare these events can be, unless you are on a tech bench day in and day out, reference materials such as the Motherboard manual and your search engine of choice can be tremendous assets. Just remember to make sure that everything is seated correctly, you have at least the minimum required components to boot, and most importantly that you have all of your connections on the correct pins.</ul></ol><hr /><h2 id="security-field">security field</h2><ol><li>Are open-source projects more or less secure than proprietary ones?<li>Who do you look up to within the field of Information Security?

You can fix it, but it is out of your jurisdiction. What do you do?<li>How would you compromise an “office workstation” at a hotel?<li>What is worse in firewall detection, a false negative or a false positive? And why?<li>How would you judge if a remote server is running IIS or Apache?<li><p>What is the difference between an HIDS and a NIDS?</p><li>use SSH from a Windows pc?<ul><li>SSH (TCP port 22) is a secure connection used on many different systems and dedicated appliances.<li>Routers, Switches, SFTP servers and insecure programs being tunnelled through this port all can be used to help harden a connection against eavesdropping.<li>the SSH protocol itself is implemented on a wide variety of systems - Linux, Windows.<li>Programs like PuTTY, Filezilla and others have Windows ports available, which allow Windows users the same ease-of-use connectivity to these devices as do Linux users.</ul><li>TTL?<ul><li>Time To Live.<li>When a TCP packet is sent, its TTL is set, which is the number of routers (hops) it can pass through before the packet is discarded.<li>As the packet passes through a router the TTL is decremented until, when the TTL reaches zero, the packet is destroyed and an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ICMP “time exceeded” message is returned.</code><li>The return message’s TTL is set by the terminating router when it creates the packet and decremented normally.<li>The TTL is an IP <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">header field</code><li>to prevent packets from running into endless loops.</ul></ol><h3 id="traceroute">traceroute</h3><ol><li>What protocol does traceroute use?<ul><li>Traceroute works by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sending a packet to an open UDP port</code> on a destination machine.<li>The type of packet that is sent differs depending on the implementation. By default<li>Windows uses ICMP.<li>Mac OS X and Linux use UDP.<li>All versions of traceroute rely on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ICMP type 11 (Time exceeded) responses</code> from each hop along the route.<li>If ICMP type 11 responses are being blocked by your firewall, traceroute will not work.<li>These packets are inbound, not outbound.</ul><li>How exactly does <strong>traceroute/tracert</strong> work?<ul><li>client:<ul><li>Traceroute transmits packets with small TTL values.<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setting the TTL for a packet to 1</code></ul><li>sending it towards the requested destination host, and listening for the reply.<ul><li>When the initiating machine receives a “time exceeded” response, it examines the packet to determine where the packet came from<li>this identifies the machine one hop away.</ul><li>The router<ul><li>discards the packet<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sends off an ICMP notification packet to the original host</code> with the message that the TTL expired from the router.</ul><li><p>Then the tracing machine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generates a new packet with TTL 2</code>, and uses the response to determine the machine 2 hops away, and so on.</p><li><strong>not all TCP stacks behave correctly</strong>.<ul><li>Some TCP stacks <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set the TTL for the ICMP “time exceeded” message</code> to that of the message being killed.<ul><li>So if the TTL is 0, the packet will be killed by the next machine to which it is passed.</ul><li>This can have two effects on a trace.<ul><li>If the computer is an intermediate machine in the trace,</ul><li>the entry remain blank.<li>No information is returned because the “time exceeded” message never makes it back.<ul><li>If the machine you are doing a trace to has this bug in its TCP stack,</ul><li>return packets won’t reach the originating machine unless the TTL is high enough to cover the round trip.<li>So Trace Route will show a number of failed connections equal to n (the number of hops to the destination machine) minus 1.</ul></ul><li>How would traceroute help you find out where a breakdown in communication is?<ul><li>to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">see exactly what routers touched</code> as move along the chain of connections to final destination.<li>if end up with a problem where can’t connect/ping the destination,<li>a tracert can help to tell exactly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where</code> the chain of connections stop.<li>contact the correct people – your own firewall, ISP, destination’s ISP or somewhere in the middle.</ul><li>How many packets must leave my NIC to complete a traceroute to twitter.com?<ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">they need to factor in all layers: Ethernet, IP, DNS, ICMP/UDP, etc. And they need to consider round-trip times</code>.<li>The top 3-4 levels of the OSI model are not used<ul><li>(depending on the the operating system)<ul><li>traceroute makes a request to the networking library<li>send either an ICMP (layer 3) or UDP (layer 4) packet to the destination<li>with a TTL of 1,</ul><li>the response that is returned includes information presented to the user and the TTL is increased to 2 for the next packet and sent.<li>This proceeds until the destination is reached.</ul><li>The packets themselves are constructed at the bit level for level 1, to individual frames in level 2, packed in a ‘packet’ in layer 3.<li>Then the remaining transformations depend on whether UDP is used or ICMP.</ul><li><strong>configure trace route in a cisco firewall</strong> for a group of windows users?<ul><li>Windows uses ICMP for traceroute, Linux technically uses UDP.<li>Therefore, the responses they get from the devices along the path is different, depending on which source device you used to initiate the trace.<li>For Windows, need an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inbound rule allowing icmp time-exceeded</code>.<li>For Linux, need an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inbound rule allowing icmp unreachable</code>.<li>For both, need to add an “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inspect icmp</code>” statement.</ul></ol><hr /><h2

</pre><td class="rouge-code"><pre>6. What is a Docker Container?
Docker containers include the application and all of its dependencies. It shares the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system. Docker containers are not tied to any specific infrastructure: they run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud. Docker containers are basically runtime instances of Docker images.

7. What are Docker Images?
When you mention Docker images, your very next question will be “what are Docker images”.

Docker image is the source of Docker container. In other words, Docker images are used to create containers. When a user runs a Docker image, an instance of a container is created. These docker images can be deployed to any Docker environment.

8. What is Docker Hub?
Docker images create docker containers. There has to be a registry where these docker images live. This registry is Docker Hub. Users can pick up images from Docker Hub and use them to create customized images and containers. Currently, the Docker Hub is the world’s largest public repository of image containers.

9. Explain Docker Architecture?
Docker Architecture consists of a Docker Engine which is a client-server application with three major components:

A server which is a type of long-running program called a daemon process (the docker command).
A REST API which specifies interfaces that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instruct it what to do.
A command line interface (CLI) client (the docker command).
The CLI uses the Docker REST API to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI.
Refer to this blog, to read more about Docker Architecture.

10. What is a Dockerfile?
Let’s start by giving a small explanation of Dockerfile and proceed by giving examples and commands to support your arguments.

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a file called Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build, users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

The interviewer does not just expect definitions, hence explain how to use a Dockerfile which comes with experience. Have a look at this tutorial to understand how Dockerfile works.

11. Tell us something about Docker Compose.
Docker Compose is a YAML file which contains details about the services, networks, and volumes for setting up the Docker application. So, you can use Docker Compose to create separate containers, host them and get them to communicate with each other. Each container will expose a port for communicating with other containers.

12. What is Docker Swarm?
You are expected to have worked with Docker Swarm as it’s an important concept of Docker.

Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker host. Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API, any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts.

13. What is a Docker Namespace?
A namespace is one of the Linux features and an important concept of containers. Namespace adds a layer of isolation in containers. Docker provides various namespaces in order to stay portable and not affect the underlying host system. Few namespace types supported by Docker – PID, Mount, IPC, User, Network

14. What is the lifecycle of a Docker Container?
This is one of the most popular questions asked in Docker interviews. Docker containers have the following lifecycle:

Create a container
Run the container
Pause the container(optional)
Un-pause the container(optional)
Start the container
Stop the container
Restart the container
Kill the container
Destroy the container
15. What is Docker Machine?
Docker machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts. These hosts can now be managed using the docker-machine commands. Docker machine also lets you provision Docker Swarm Clusters.

Docker Basic Commands
Once you’ve aced the basic conceptual questions, the interviewer will increase the difficulty level. So let’s move on to the next section of this Docker Interview Questions article. This section talks about the commands that are very common amongst docker users.

16. How to check for Docker Client and Docker Server version?
The following command gives you information about Docker Client and Server versions:

$ docker version

17. How do you get the number of containers running, paused and stopped?
You can use the following command to get detailed information about the docker installed on your system.

$ docker info

Course Curriculum
DevOps Certification Training
Instructor-led SessionsReal-life Case StudiesAssignmentsLifetime Access
You can get the number of containers running, paused, stopped, the number of images and a lot more.

18. If you vaguely remember the command and you’d like to confirm it, how will you get help on that particular command?
The following command is very useful as it gives you help on how to use a command, the syntax, etc.

$ docker --help

The above command lists all Docker commands. If you need help with one specific command, you can use the following syntax:

$ docker &lt;command&gt; --help

19. How to login into docker repository?
You can use the following command to login into hub.docker.com:

$ docker login

You’ll be prompted for your username and password, insert those and congratulations, you’re logged in.

20. If you wish to use a base image and make modifications or personalize it, how do you do that?
You pull an image from docker hub onto your local system

It’s one simple command to pull an image from docker hub:

$ docker pull &lt;image_name&gt;

21. How do you create a docker container from an image?
Pull an image from docker repository with the above command and run it to create a container. Use the following command:

$ docker run -it -d &lt;image_name&gt;

Most probably the next question would be, what does the ‘-d’ flag mean in the command?

-d means the container needs to start in the detached mode. Explain a little about the detach mode. Have a look at this blog to get a better understanding of different docker commands.

22. How do you list all the running containers?
The following command lists down all the running containers:

$ docker ps

23. Suppose you have 3 containers running and out of these, you wish to access one of them. How do you access a running container?
The following command lets us access a running container:

$ docker exec -it &lt;container id&gt; bash

The exec command lets you get inside a container and work with it.

24. How to start, stop and kill a container?

The following command is used to start a docker container:

$ docker start &lt;container_id&gt;

and the following for stopping a running container:

$ docker stop &lt;container_id&gt;

kill a container with the following command:

$ docker kill &lt;container_id&gt;

25. Can you use a container, edit it, and update it? Also, how do you make it a new and store it on the local system?
Of course, you can use a container, edit it and update it. This sounds complicated but its actually just one command.

$ docker commit &lt;container id&gt; &lt;username/imagename&gt;

26. Once you’ve worked with an image, how do you push it to docker hub?
$ docker push &lt;username/image name&gt;

27. How to delete a stopped container?
Use the following command to delete a stopped container:

$ docker rm &lt;container id&gt;

DevOps Training
28. How to delete an image from the local storage system?
The following command lets you delete an image from the local system:

$ docker rmi &lt;image-id&gt;

29. How to build a Dockerfile?
Once you’ve written a Dockerfile, you need to build it to create an image with those specifications. Use the following command to build a Dockerfile:

$ docker build &lt;path to docker file&gt;

The next question would be when do you use “.dockerfile_name” and when to use the entire path?

Use “.dockerfile_name” when the dockerfile exits in the same file directory and you use the entire path if it lives somewhere else.

30. Do you know why docker system prune is used? What does it do?
$ docker system prune

The above command is used to remove all the stopped containers, all the networks that are not used, all dangling images and all build caches. It’s one of the most useful docker commands.

Docker Advanced Questions
Once the interviewer knows that you’re familiar with the Docker commands, he/she will start asking about practical applications This section of Docker Interview Questions consists of questions that you’ll only be able to answer when you’ve gained some experience working with Docker.

31. Will you lose your data, when a docker container exists?
No, you won’t lose any data when Docker container exits. Any data that your application writes to the container gets preserved on the disk until you explicitly delete the container. The file system for the container persists even after the container halts.

32. Where all do you think Docker is being used?
When asked such a question, respond by talking about applications of Docker. Docker is being used in the following areas:

Simplifying configuration: Docker lets you put your environment and configuration into code and deploy it.
Code Pipeline Management: There are different systems used for development and production. As the code travels from development to testing to production, it goes through a difference in the environment. Docker helps in maintaining the code pipeline consistency.
Developer Productivity: Using Docker for development gives us two things – We’re closer to production and development environment is built faster.
Application Isolation: As containers are applications wrapped together with all dependencies, your apps are isolated. They can work by themselves on any hardware that supports Docker.
Debugging Capabilities: Docker supports various debugging tools that are not specific to containers but work well with containers.
Multi-tenancy: Docker lets you have multi-tenant applications avoiding redundancy in your codes and deployments.
Rapid Deployment: Docker eliminates the need to boost an entire OS from scratch, reducing the deployment time.
33. How is Docker different from other containerization methods?
Docker containers are very easy to deploy in any cloud platform. It can get more applications running on the same hardware when compared to other technologies, it makes it easy for developers to quickly create, ready-to-run containerized applications and it makes managing and deploying applications much easier. You can even share containers with your applications.

If you have some more points to add you can do that but make sure the above explanation is there in your answer.

34. Can I use JSON instead of YAML for my compose file in Docker?
You can use JSON instead of YAML for your compose file, to use JSON file with compose, specify the JSON filename to use, for eg:

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.json up

35. How have you used Docker in your previous position?
Explain how you have used Docker to help rapid deployment. Explain how you have scripted Docker and used it with other tools like Puppet, Chef or Jenkins. If you have no past practical experience in Docker and instead have experience with other tools in a similar space, be honest and explain the same. In this case, it makes sense if you can compare other tools to Docker in terms of functionality.

36. How far do Docker containers scale? Are there any requirements for the same?
Large web deployments like Google and Twitter and platform providers such as Heroku and dotCloud, all run on container technology. Containers can be scaled to hundreds of thousands or even millions of them running in parallel. Talking about requirements, containers require the memory and the OS at all the times and a way to use this memory efficiently when scaled.

37. What platforms does docker run on?
This is a very straightforward question but can get tricky. Do some company research before going for the interview and find out how the company is using Docker. Make sure you mention the platform company is using in this answer.

Docker runs on various Linux administration:

Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 et al
Fedora 19/20+
RHEL 6.5+
CentOS 6+
Gentoo
ArchLinux
openSUSE 12.3+
CRUX 3.0+
It can also be used in production with Cloud platforms with the following services:

Amazon EC2
Amazon ECS
Google Compute Engine
Microsoft Azure
Rackspace
38. Is there a way to identify the status of a Docker container?
There are six possible states a container can be at any given point – Created, Running, Paused, Restarting, Exited, Dead.

Use the following command to check for docker state at any given point:

$ docker ps

The above command lists down only running containers by default. To look for all containers, use the following command:

$ docker ps -a

39. Can you remove a paused container from Docker?
The answer is no. You cannot remove a paused container. The container has to be in the stopped state before it can be removed.

40. Can a container restart by itself?
No, it’s not possible for a container to restart by itself. By default the flag -restart is set to false.

41. Is it better to directly remove the container using the rm command or stop the container followed by remove container?
Its always better to stop the container and then remove it using the remove command.

$ docker stop &lt;coontainer_id&gt;
$ docker rm -f &lt;container_id&gt;

Stopping the container and then removing it will allow sending SIG_HUP signal to recipients. This will ensure that all the containers have enough time to clean up their tasks. This method is considered a good practice, avoiding unwanted errors.

42. Will cloud overtake the use of Containerization?
Docker containers are gaining popularity but at the same time, Cloud services are giving a good fight. In my personal opinion, Docker will never be replaced by Cloud. Using cloud services with containerization will definitely hype the game. Organizations need to take their requirements and dependencies into consideration into the picture and decide what’s best for them. Most of the companies have integrated Docker with the cloud. This way they can make the best out of both the technologies.

43. How many containers can run per host?
There can be as many containers as you wish per host. Docker does not put any restrictions on it. But you need to consider every container needs storage space, CPU and memory which the hardware needs to support. You also need to consider the application size. Containers are considered to be lightweight but very dependent on the host OS.

44. Is it a good practice to run stateful applications on Docker?
The concept behind stateful applications is that they store their data onto the local file system. You need to decide to move the application to another machine, retrieving data becomes painful. I honestly would not prefer running stateful applications on Docker.

45. Suppose you have an application that has many dependent services. Will docker compose wait for the current container to be ready to move to the running of the next service?
The answer is yes. Docker compose always runs in the dependency order. These dependencies are specifications like depends_on, links, volumes_from, etc.

46. How will you monitor Docker in production?
Docker provides functionalities like docker stats and docker events to monitor docker in production. Docker stats provides CPU and memory usage of the container. Docker events provide information about the activities taking place in the docker daemon.

47. Is it a good practice to run Docker compose in production?
Yes, using docker compose in production is the best practical application of docker compose. When you define applications with compose, you can use this compose definition in various production stages like CI, staging, testing, etc.

48. What changes are expected in your docker compose file while moving it to production?
These are the following changes you need make to your compose file before migrating your application to the production environment:

Remove volume bindings, so the code stays inside the container and cannot be changed from outside the container.
Binding to different ports on the host.
Specify a restart policy
Add extra services like log aggregator
49. Have you used Kubernetes? If you have, which one would you prefer amongst Docker and Kubernetes?
Be very honest in such questions. If you have used Kubernetes, talk about your experience with Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. Point out the key areas where you thought docker swarm was more efficient and vice versa. Have a look at this blog for understanding differences between Docker and Kubernetes.

You Docker interview questions are not just limited to the workarounds of docker but also other similar tools. Hence be prepared with tools/technologies that give Docker competition. One such example is Kubernetes.

50. Are you aware of load balancing across containers and hosts? How does it work?
While using docker service with multiple containers across different hosts, you come across the need to load balance the incoming traffic. Load balancing and HAProxy is basically used to balance the incoming traffic across different available(healthy) containers. If one container crashes, another container should automatically start running and the traffic should be re-routed to this new running container. Load balancing and HAProxy works around this concept.

This brings us to the end of the Docker Interview Questions article. With increasing business competition, companies have realized the importance of adapting and taking advantage of the changing market. Few things that kept them in the game were faster scaling of systems, better software delivery, adapting to new technologies, etc. That’s when docker swung into the picture and gave these companies boosting support to continue the race.
