You can elastically scale resources up and down in an automated fashion. With the cloud computing model, you can treat resources as temporary and disposable.<li>The flexibility that cloud computing offers enables businesses to implement new solutions quickly and with low upfront costs.<li>Compared to hardware solutions, software solutions can change much more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively.</ul><li>Cloud computing helps <em>eliminate undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks</em> like procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning, thus enabling them to focus on what matters most.<li><em>several different service models and deployment strategies</em> emerged to meet the specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service model and deployment strategy provides you with a different level of control, flexibility, and management. Understanding the differences between these cloud service models and deployment strategies can help you decide what set of services is right for your needs.<li>It typically <em>provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space</em>.<li>IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar.</ul><li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong><ul><li>PaaS <em>removes the management of underlying infrastructure</em> (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the <em>deployment and management of your applications</em>.<li>This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.</ul><li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong><ul><li>SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to <em>end-user applications</em> (such as web-based email).<li>With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.</ul></ul><h3 id="three-main-cloud-computing-deployment-models">three main cloud computing deployment models</h3><ul><li>represent the cloud environments that your applications can be deployed in:<li><strong>Cloud</strong>:<li>A <em>cloud-based application</em> is fully deployed in the cloud, and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure.<li>Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or they can use higher-level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.<li><strong>Hybrid</strong>:<li>A hybrid deployment is a way to <em>connect infrastructure/applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources not in cloud</em>. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and <em>existing on-premises infrastructure</em>.<li>This model enables an organization to extend and grow their infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems.<li><strong>On-premises</strong>:<li>Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, sometimes called private cloud.<li>While on-premises deployment does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources.<li>In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure, but it might also use application management and virtualization technologies to increase resource utilization.</ul><h3 id="six-advantages-of-cloud-computing">six advantages of cloud computing</h3><ol><li>Advantage #1 — Trade <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capital expense</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable expense</code>:<ul><li>Capital expenses (capex): funds that a company uses to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings, or equipment.<li>variable expense: expense that the person who bears the cost can easily alter or avoid.<li>Maintenance is reduced</ul><li>Advantage #2 — Benefit from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">massive economies of scale</code>:<ul><li>a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.</ul><li>Advantage #3 — Stop guessing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">capacity</code>:<ul><li>Eliminate guessing infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before you deploy an application, expensive idle resources / limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.</ul><li>Advantage #4 — Increase <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">speed and agility</code>:<ul><li>In cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, reduce the time to make those resources available. dramatic increase agility for the organization because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop are significantly lower.</ul><li>Advantage #5 — Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers:<ul><li>Focus on projects that differentiate your business instead of focusing on the infrastructure.</ul><li>Advantage #6 — <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Go global</code> in minutes:<ul><li>You can deploy your application in multiple AWSRegions around the world with just a few clicks. provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.</ul></ol><ul><li>Agility 敏捷 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/ə'dʒiləti/</code><ul><li><em>easy access</em> to a broad range of technologies to innovate faster and build nearly anything.<li>You can quickly spin up resources as you need them from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to IoT, machine learning, data lakes and analytics…<li>You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before.<li>the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.</ul><li>Elasticity 弹力 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/elæ'stɪsɪtɪ/</code><ul><li>avoid over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. but the amount of resources that actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.</ul><li>Cost savings<ul><li>The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.</ul><li>Deploy globally in minutes<ul><li>With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes.<li>For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.<li>Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience.</ul></ul><p>similarities between AWS and the traditional, on-premises IT space:</p><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://i.imgur.com/PGeBOJo.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-04 at 16.22.11" /></p><h3 id="the-main-amazon-web-services-aws-service-categories-and-core-services">the main Amazon Web Services AWS service categories and core services</h3><p>web service</p><ul><li>is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet or on private (intranet) networks.<li>uses a standardized format — such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)—for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction.

Connection to these services does not require an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. There are two types of VPC endpoints:•An interface VPC endpoint(interface endpoint) enables you to connect to services that are powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services that are hosted by other AWS customers and AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners in their own VPCs (referred to as endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace APN Partner services. The owner of the service is the service provider, and you—as the principal who creates the interface endpoint—are the service consumer. You are charged for creating and using an interface endpoint to a service. Hourly usage rates and data processing rates apply. See the AWS Documentation for a list of supported interface endpointsand for more information about the example shown here.•Gateway endpoints: The use of gateway endpoints incurs no additional charge. Standard charges for data transfer and resource usage apply.</p><p>.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/01aws/'>01AWS</a>, <a href='/categories/awslab/'>AWSLab</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/aws/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >AWS</a> <a href="/tags/lab/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >Lab</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=AWS Lab -
