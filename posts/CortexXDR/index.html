People
- roles such as security analysts, security architects, security engineers, and administrators.

ASK:
Which roles do their people play and which skills do they have?
Who has overall responsibility for cybersecurity?
What is the level of skill available to those who would work with Cortex XDR?
How does the security team work with the network team?
What is the big picture about how these people organize their cybersecurity work?
Do they have red teams and blue teams?
Do they regularly engage penetration testing or do other security assessment?
Does the customer have tightly defined formal cybersecurity roles?


alerts
- Most customers have too many alerts, and this is a huge issue to manage.
- These alert issues are exactly the issues that Cortex XDR helps them address.
ASK:
Does the customer have orders-of-magnitude too many alerts?
How do they approach the challenge of too many alerts?
How do they determine which alerts to investigate?
When the customer receives related alerts, how are they linked together?
Is it easy for the customer to make full use of information about linked alerts?


SIEMs
- Cortex XDR is not a SIEM and does not replace SIEM functionality.
- SIEMs collect logs from various sources. They often normalize these logs and prioritize alerts.
- Cortex XDR also collects data from various sources. It has native integration with these sources to both collect data and enforce protection and SIEMs don’t do this.
- It collects rich data from network, endpoint, and cloud sources.
- The data SIEMs collect is often not sufficiently rich. Cortex XDR uses this rich data to help security operations teams investigate threats and to detect and help hunt even sophisticated attacks. SIEMs are beginning to offer detection capability but generally do not do detection and hunting. Cortex XDR also responds and provides enforcement back to those points, and traditional SIEMs do not do this.
- Cortex XDR is better suited to work with a SIEM, rather than replacing one that has already been deployed.
ASK
Which SIEMs does the customer use?
Where do the SIEMs get their data?
Is the data coming from their SIEMs consistent?
Are they able to do analysis on SIEM data?
How do they do analysis on their SIEM data?

id="suggested-se-approaches">Suggested SE Approaches</h3><p>SEs have provided suggestions on how to approach customer opportunities.</p><p>Proof of Concept</p><ul><li>Proof of Concepts (POCs) with Cortex XDR are often not as effective as POCs with other products, it needs a 30-day baseline of behavior, which is often hard to arrange.<li>And it is sometimes hard to arrange for an advanced persistent threat or other threat that Cortex XDR shines with.<li>Generally, use a POC when the customer wants the product’s functionality, but needs to ensure it doesn’t impact the customer’s operation.<li>However, a guided evaluation can be very effective. During one sales opportunity and guided evaluation, a customer engaged a penetration tester, and the SE identified an anomalous behavior of ipconfig /all. This led to the discovery of the tester, and convinced the customer to purchase the product.<li>Before discussing POCs or guided evaluations with customers, synchronize with sales on rules, context, scope, strategy, and expected outcomes. Stay aware of product lock down schedules.</ul><p>Existing Palo Alto Networks Firewall Use</p><ul><li>Many customers still use our firewalls primarily on their perimeter, and do not segment their networks.<li>Educate these customers on the value of segmentation.<li>It is often a good strategy to sell only Cortex XDR endpoint prevention to customers who don’t segment.<li>Cortex XDR analytics using endpoint data only is also a possibility, but this typically provides only about half of the Cortex XDR analytics functionality. It’s a better product when combined with network logs from a fully segmented environment.</ul><p>SOCs</p><ul><li>Many customers do not currently have SOCs, but still run into the same challenges that SOCs face.<li>Customers do not need large SOCs to benefit from purchasing Cortex XDR.</ul><p>Strategically Preventing Unknown Threats</p><ul><li>Customers often need to be explicitly taught the value of preventing unknown threats. They all understand the risk of applying patches but many may not fully appreciate the risk of not applying patches. Cortex XDR reduces that risk.<li>Cortex XDR Prevent is very strong as a best of breed EDR. But credibly explaining and demoing the XDR approach of combining rich data from multiple sources to enable more accuracy and a better picture of what is happening with an attack is often what convinces customers to go with Cortex XDR.</ul><p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://i.imgur.com/3U1WKCt.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-10-24 at 00.05.22" /></p><p><img data-proofer-ignore

Exploits sometimes manipulate the operating system's memory management.
This manipulation can be used to allow a weaponized data file to redirect applications to execute an attacker's intended commands.


Logic Flaw Prevention
exploits manipulate an application's process management.
allows the exploit to do things like alter system privilege management mechanisms.
can manipulate the local file system or modify the location where dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are loaded and replace a legitimate DLL with the exploit’s malicious DLL with sufficient privilege.
This is called “DLL hijacking.”
The Logic Flaw Prevention method recognizes these exploitation techniques and stops them before they succeed.


Code Execution Prevention
Exploits to execute an attacker’s malicious commands, embedded in an exploit data file.
Code Execution Prevention recognizes exploitation techniques that allow an attacker’s malicious codes to execute and blocks them before they succeed.

data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ITS6Szb.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-10 at 12.37.56" /></p><ol><li><strong>Phase 1: Evaluation of Child Process Protection Policy</strong><ul><li>When a user attempts to run an executable, the operating system attempts to run the executable as a process.<li>If the process tries to launch any child processes, the Cortex XDR agent first evaluates the <kbd>child process protection policy</kbd>.<li>If the parent process is a known targeted process that attempts to launch a restricted child process, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the child processes from running and reports the security event to Cortex XDR.<li>For example,<li>if a user tries to open a Microsoft Word document (using the winword.exe process) and that document has a macro that tries to run a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blocked child process (such as WScript)</code>, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the child process and reports the event to Cortex XDR.<li>If the parent process does not try to launch any child processes or tries to launch a child process that is not restricted, the Cortex XDR agent next moves to Phase 2: Evaluation of the Restriction Policy.</ul><li><strong>Phase 2: Evaluation of the Restriction Policy</strong><ul><li>When a user or machine attempts to open an executable file, the Cortex XDR agent first evaluates the child process protection policy as described in Phase 1: Evaluation of Child Process Protection Policy.<li>The Cortex XDR agent next verifies that the executable file does not violate any <kbd>restriction rules</kbd>.<li>For example,<li>have a restriction rule that blocks executable files launched from network locations.<li>If a restriction rule applies to an executable file, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the file from executing and reports the security event to Cortex XDR and, depending on the configuration of each restriction rule, the Cortex XDR agent can also notify the user about the prevention event.<li>If no restriction rules apply to an executable file, the Cortex XDR agent next moves to Phase 3: Evaluation of Hash Verdicts.</ul><li><strong>Phase 3: Hash Verdict Determination</strong><ul><li>The Cortex XDR agent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calculates a unique hash using the SHA-256</code> algorithm for every file that attempts to run on the endpoint.<li>Depending on the features that you enable, the Cortex XDR agent performs additional analysis to determine whether an unknown file is malicious or benign.<li>The Cortex XDR agent can also submit unknown files to Cortex XDR for in-depth analysis by WildFire.<li><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="https://i.imgur.com/ZXWNCOS.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-12-02 at 02.52.24" /><li>To determine a verdict for a file, the Cortex XDR agent evaluates the file in the following order:<ol><li><strong>Hash exception</strong><ul><li>A hash exception enables you to override the verdict for a specific file without affecting the settings in your Malware Security profile.<li>The hash exception policy is evaluated first and takes precedence over all other methods to determine the hash verdict.<li>For example, you may want to configure a hash exception for any of the following situations:<ul><li>• You want to block a file that has a benign verdict.<li>• You want to allow a file that has a malware verdict to run.<ul><li>recommend that you only override the verdict for malware after you use available threat intelligence resources—such as WildFire and AutoFocus—to determine that the file is not malicious.</ul><li>• You want to specify a verdict for a file that has not yet received an official WildFire verdict.</ul><li>After you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">configure a hash exception</code>, Cortex XDR distributes it at the next heartbeat communication with any endpoints that have previously opened the file.<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">When a file launches on the endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent first evaluates any relevant hash exception for the file</code>.<ul><li>The hash exception specifies whether to treat the file as malware.<li>If the file is assigned a benign verdict, the Cortex XDR agent permits it to open.<li>If a hash exception is not configured for the file, the Cortex XDR agent next evaluates the verdict to determine the likelihood of malware.</ul><li>multi-step evaluation process in the following order to determine the verdict: Highly trusted signers, WildFire verdict, and then Local analysis.</ul><li><strong>Highly trusted signers (Windows and Mac)</strong><ul><li>The Cortex XDR agent distinguishes highly trusted signers such as Microsoft from other known signers.<li>To keep parity with the signers defined in WildFire, Palo Alto Networks regularly reviews the list of highly trusted and known signers and delivers any changes with content updates.<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The list of highly trusted signers also includes signers in allow list from Cortex XDR</code>.<li>When an unknown file attempts to run, the Cortex XDR agent applies the following evaluation criteria:<ul><li>Files signed by highly trusted signers are permitted to run<li>files signed by prevented signers are blocked, regardless of the WildFire verdict.<li>when a file is not signed by a highly trusted signer or by a signer included in the block list, the Cortex XDR agent next evaluates the WildFire verdict.<li>For Windows endpoints, evaluation of other known signers takes place if WildFire evaluation returns an unknown verdict for the file.</ul></ul><li><strong>WildFire verdict</strong><ul><li>If a file is not signed by a highly trusted signer on Windows and Mac endpoints, the Cortex XDR agent performs a hash verdict lookup to determine if a verdict already exists in its local cache.<li>If the executable file has a malware verdict, the Cortex XDR agent reports the security event to the Cortex XDR and, depending on the configured behavior for malicious files, the Cortex XDR agent then does one of the following:<ul><li>• Blocks the malicious executable file<li>• Blocks and quarantines the malicious executable file<li>• Notifies the user about the file but still allows the file to execute<li>• Logs the issue without notifying the user and allows the file to execute.</ul><li>If the verdict is benign, the Cortex XDR agent moves on to the next stage of evaluation (Phase 4: Evaluation of Malware Protection Policy).<li>If the hash does not exist in the local cache or has an unknown verdict, the Cortex XDR agent next evaluates whether the file is signed by a known signer.</ul><li><strong>Local analysis</strong><ul><li>When an unknown executable, DLL, or macro attempts to run on a Windows or Mac endpoint, the Cortex XDR agent uses local analysis to determine if it is likely to be malware.<ul><li>On Windows endpoints, if the file is signed by a known signer, the Cortex XDR agent permits the file to run and does not perform additional analysis.<li>For files on Mac endpoints and files that are not signed by a known signer on Windows endpoints, the Cortex XDR agent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">performs local analysis to determine whether the file is malware</code>.</ul><li>Local analysis uses a statistical model that was developed with machine learning on WildFire threat intelligence.<li>The model enables the Cortex XDR agent to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">examine hundreds of characteristics for a file and issue a local verdict (benign or malicious) while the endpoint is offline or Cortex XDR is unreachable</code>.<li>The Cortex XDR agent can rely on the local analysis verdict until it receives an official WildFire verdict or hash exception.<li>Local analysis is enabled by default in a Malware Security profile.<li>Because local analysis always returns a verdict for an unknown file,<ul><li>if enable the Cortex XDR agent to Block files with unknown verdict, the agent only blocks unknown files if a local analysis error occurs or local analysis is disabled.</ul><li>To change the default settings (not recommended), see Add a New Malware Security Profile.</ul></ol></ul><li><strong>Phase 4: Evaluation of Malware Security Policy</strong><ul><li>If the prior evaluation phases do not identify a file as malware, the Cortex XDR agent observes the behavior of the file and applies additional malware protection rules.<li>If a file exhibits malicious behavior, such as encryption-based activity common with ransomware, the Cortex XDR agent blocks the file and reports the security event to the Cortex XDR.<li>If no malicious behavior is detected, the Cortex XDR agent permits the file (process) to continue running but continues to monitor the behavior for the lifetime of the process.</ul></ol><hr /><h2 id="exploits-and-patches">Exploits and Patches</h2><p>Cortex XDR prevents known as well as unknown exploits and malware, even on unpatched

Analytics</h2><p>Behavioral Analytics</p><ul><li>Cortex XDR Pro applies behavioral analytics to network and endpoint data to find hard-to-detect attack activity.<li>This activity includes behavior such as<ul><li>low and slow reconnaissance<li>or one machine attempting to control another machine.</ul><li>This works because even after malware is installed, an attacker must often perform thousands of actions.<ul><li>Each single action, such as a user connecting to an unknown site, might look innocent.<li>But by profiling a baseline of behavior, organizations can detect behavioral changes that attackers cannot conceal.</ul></ul><p>Cortex XDR applies machine learning to its behavioral analytics with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">models of behavior</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">profiles of objects</code>.</p><ul><li>Cortex XDR uses three behavior models in its analysis:<ul><li>command and control communication,<li>lateral movement,<li>and exfiltration.<li>Cortex XDR looks for chains of events to fit these models to automatically detect them.</ul><li>Profiles<ul><li>Time profiles: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compare past user and device activity to current</code> user and device activity.<li>Peer profiles: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compare peer users and

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Behavioral Analytics</code> Can Detect:</p><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Targeted Manual Attacks by external attackers</code>.<ul><li>These often lead to costly breaches.<li>The average cost per incident of these breaches is $3.6 million.<li>But large scale breaches can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.</ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Malicious Insiders</code><ul><li>exploit trusted credentials and cause major damage.<li>take months to discover, because the users are trusted.<li>But Cortex XDR Pro can detect this anomalous behavior.</ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reckless Users</code><ul><li>Risky activity by well-meaning but reckless users can also lead to data breaches.<li>Human error, such as a user posting valuable data on the internet, is directly responsible for about 15% of all breaches.<li>But risky behavior can also invite external attacks.<li>It’s hard to detect threats and the increased risk of attack when users upload large files to unsanctioned sites or share credentials.<li>Cortex XDR Pro detects this behavior.</ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Compromised Endpoints</code><ul><li>Compromised endpoints represent exploits that have succeeded, and often can be the source of attacks that go undetected.<li>These also can be detected by applying machine learning-informed behavioral analytics that Cortex XDR provides.</ul><li><code class="language-plaintext
