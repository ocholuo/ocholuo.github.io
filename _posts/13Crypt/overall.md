# Modern Cryptography


Modern cryptosystems use computationally complex algorithms and long cryptographic keys to meet the cryptographic goals of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation.


3 types of algorithms commonly used today:
- symmetric encryption algorithms,
- asymmetric encryption algorithms,
- hashing algorithms.

## Key Requirements

symmetric cryptosystems require each pair of potential communicators have a shared private key makes the algorithm nonscalable.
- The total number of keys: Number of Keys = n* (n âˆ’ 1)/ 2
- the larger the population,
- the less likely a symmetric cryptosystem will be suitable to meet its needs.


asymmetric:
- communication among n users, n distinct private/public key pairs are needed.
