## WRITE-UPS

I have been fortunate enough to meet great folks, come across ample valuable resources, have the opportunity to learn my favorite security field, and been able to have my step in Cyber Security.

I have documented the exercises and learning path throughout my journey, and hope it can also be helpful for you in your study.

This blog is all about:
- Knowledge from work
- Classroom learning
- Online learning
- Security certifications learning
- Hands-on training (CTFs, labs, hackathons, etc)
